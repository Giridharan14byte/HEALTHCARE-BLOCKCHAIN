 🏥 Healthcare Blockchain – Electronic Health Records (EHR) Demo

 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Blockchain technology can be applied in the Healthcare domain to manage and secure Electronic Health Records (EHRs).
The goal is to ensure:

* ✅ Immutability – Records cannot be altered once added.
* ✅ Transparency – Each block links to the previous one using cryptographic hashes.
* ✅ Security – Patient data integrity is maintained.
* ✅ Retrievability – Patients’ records can be safely retrieved without tampering.

 🛑 Problem Statement

Traditional healthcare systems store patient data in centralized databases, making them prone to:

* 🔓 Unauthorized access
* ✏️ Data tampering
* 🧩 Lack of interoperability between hospitals/clinics

This raises concerns regarding data privacy, accuracy, and trust.

 💡 Blockchain-Based Solution

Using a blockchain, each patient record is stored as a block containing:

* Patient ID
* Medical Diagnosis
* Treatment Plan
* Timestamp
* Cryptographic Hash & Previous Hash

This ensures that any attempt to modify a block breaks the chain, making tampering immediately detectable.

 ⚙️ Features

* ➕ Add new patient medical records
* 📂 Retrieve patient records by ID
* 🔍 Validate the blockchain for tampering
* 🛡️ Demonstrate tamper-proof security
